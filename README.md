## Inventory Analysis

### Business Need
The inventory analysis aims to optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts and excess inventory, streamline processes, and develop a sustainable strategy. Key tasks include:
- Demand forecasting
- In-depth analysis and reorder point calculations
- Process improvement

### Target Users
- Inventory Managers
- Supply Chain Analysts
- Retailers & E-commerce Businesses

### Success Metrics
- Improved forecasting accuracy
- Reduction in stockouts & excess inventory
- Decrease in processing time for inventory management

### Setup & Running Instructions
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Performance Considerations
- The model scales with more data but may require GPU acceleration for large datasets.
- Memory optimization is performed via efficient data handling.


## Model Justification & Training
- **Algorithm:** Simple Moving Average for demand forecasting
- **Training Steps:** Data preprocessing, time-series analysis
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Window size for moving average (30 days)
